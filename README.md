Introduction to engineering jobs at Qubit

When our founders were at Google, they got first-hand experience of the kind of culture that breeds success in technology companies... Lightning talks, stand up meetings, spontaneous brainstorms, idea sharing, Sonos, ski trips, and of course, plenty of team nights out. Take these elements and combine them with the bustling energy of a young Soho-based business and you get one hot place to work.

Day to day, you’ll be wrapping your brain around some serious challenges and intellectually jousting with some of the technology sector’s smartest thinkers. Amongst our ranks we have an impressive collection of qualifications and our combined CVs feature names of world’s most innovative companies.
